      Test your devices in a controlled environment, with the added benefit of feedback from the team behind a
      working, organic farm.
    description: >-
      Covering around 180 acres of the Wye Valley, [Square Farm](https://www.squarefarmshop.co.uk/) is a family
      owned, organic farm just 3 miles from the market town of Monmouth on the English/Welsh boarder.
      <br /><br />
      The farm has been in the family for three generations, and is a mixture of livestock and arable 
      farming intended to keep the on-site shop well stocked with meat, fruit, and vegetables.
      <br /><br />
      Mockingbird Consulting have full access to the farm to test sensors that might help both Square Farm and others,
      and we're grateful to the owners for the opportunity to open this up to sensor and gateway development teams.
