The [NFU](https://www.nfuonline.com) recently [launched their proposals](https://www.nfuonline.com/news/latest-news/nfu-unveils-its-plan-for-british-farming-to-delive/) for how the UK Farming Community can reach "Net Zero" (the idea that carbon emissions are either off-set or completely eradicated) by 2040 - some 10 years before the UK Government's current target.

Mockingbird Consulting believe that technology, and specifically the Internet of Things, has a huge part to play in each area of the strategy so we've put together a list of how the IoT can help you measure, monitor, and implement the steps proposed by the NFU.

According to the NFU, emissions from UK farms presently amount to 45.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO²) equivalent a year – about one tenth of UK Green House Gas emissions. But in stark contrast to the rest of the economy only 10 per cent of this is CO². Around 40% is nitrous dioxide (N²O) and 50% is methane (CH<sup>4</sup>).

In their proposal, the NFU talk about how agriculture and the land-based economy can become both a producer and (more importantly) a consumer and storer of CO² Gas, with the aim of capturing and converting enough CO² into other forms of energy to offset the amount of N²O and CH<sup>4</sup> that the industry generates.

The Net Zero 2040 document talks about the "three pillars" of achieving the targets, which they list as follows:

   * Improving farming’s productive efficiency to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions – enabling farming to produce the same quantity of food, or more, with less inputs in smarter ways;
   * Farmland carbon storage in soils and vegetation – improving land management and changing land use to capture more carbon, through bigger hedgerows, more woodland, and especially more carbon-rich soil;
   * Boosting renewable energy and the bioeconomy to displace greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and to create GHG removal through photosynthesis and carbon capture.

The evidence, according to the NFU, suggests that within 20 years these three pillars could contribute to a reduction, offsetting, or counterbalancing of existing agricultural emissions by up to 45Mt of CO² each year so how can you, as a farmer or estates manager, start to work out how much of these gasses you currently generate so you can start to reduce them?
