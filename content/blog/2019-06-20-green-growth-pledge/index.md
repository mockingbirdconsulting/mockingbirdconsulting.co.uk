When we started Mockingbird Consulting, we did so with a view to supporting communities, farmers, and rural towns/villages in their quest to understand their environment better.

A huge part of what we do is based on practicing what we preach, and we've spent the last six months preparing our organisation so that we can monitor, measure, and report on our environmental impact as a company and what we're doing to improve.

As a result, we've been awarded the [Green Growth Pledge](https://businesswales.gov.wales/green-growth-pledge-1) certification from the Welsh Assembly Government in recognition of our efforts.
