## Improving our working environment

Our Farm Management Solution helps our customers track everything about their farm from the location of livestock and machinery through to air and soil quality.

We firmly believe that in order to provide a successful product to your customers you should use it yourself, therefore we [monitor the following](https://shared.ourdata.network/d/s5EmTLiWk/mockingbird-consulting-office-data?orgId=3) in our offices:

* Indoor air quality
* Indoor humidity
* Indoor temperature

From the data that we collect, we then make changes to our environment to improve and areas where we find defects.  As an example, we might add house plants to an area that has low levels of humidity, or replace our thermostat with a "smart" one that we can set up to recognise when we're in the office and only supply heating at those times.

## Working with local communities

As part of our work for the Green Growth Pledge, we are working with Monmouth Town Council to notify residents when the local household recycling centre is closed.

Our hope is that by implementing an "alert system" for when the gates are shut, local residents will be able to avoid unnecessary journeys to the facilities, reducing the amount of traffic on the roads.

As this project progresses, we will be writing about it [on our blog](https://www.mockingbirdconsulting.co.uk/blog) and as part of our [case studies](https://www.mockingbirdconsulting.co.uk/case-studies).

## Working with farmers

We're already working with a partner company in Australia to [grow grapes more effectively](https://www.mockingbirdconsulting.co.uk/case-studies/joto-systems/), however one of the things we're most excited about on that particular project is the possibilities to reduce water usage and improve crop yield, making farming more efficient and thereby reducing wastage.
